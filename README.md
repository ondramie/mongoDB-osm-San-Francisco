# Goal
The goal was to data munge raw data from user-provided OpenStreetMap (OSM), to import the data into MongoDb, a non-SQL database, and to examine and summarize the data set. This file [here](https://github.com/ondramie/mongoDB-osm-San-Francisco/blob/master/osm_sf_mongoDB.md) contains a synopsis of what was done.
